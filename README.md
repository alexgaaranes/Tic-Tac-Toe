# Tic-Tac-Toe
<sub>Tic-Tac-Toe made in Python with Colorama</sub>

### TICTACTOE by Alexander Gabriel Aranes, BSCS Freshman, UPLB

 This is made as a practice for upcoming midterms of 1st semester Freshman year. This program has all my learnings through the CMSC 12 course as of October 8, 2023 integrated and made into a full game. However, this uses a data structrure which is a lesson advance than the lessons taught as of the date mentioned.

I'm willing to receive any comments and criticism to improve.
